A note about com.obnoxx.androidapp.data ...

The design of this package is a bit of a work in progress.  My general thinking
is that *Data classes are ONLY for data representation, and serialization/
deserialization from/to JSON and Android ContentValues/Bundles.  The non-*Data
classes, e.g. Sound and User, are for business logic - such as actually pulling
data from the database, orchestrating calls to the server with writes to the
database, etc.  This might not be the best separation in the world, and maybe we
want two packages to make the separation more obvious, but I think it's a step
in the right direction for now.
